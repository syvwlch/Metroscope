# What did I learn making Metroscope?

My day job is writing requirements, which someone else then magically transforms into a website people can use to do things. There is a lot more than just writing code to make that magic happen, and I wanted to get a feel for the major tasks involved.

Why?

Because seeing the world thru the eyes of the people who make that magic happen will make my requirements better.
