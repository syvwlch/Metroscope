Experiments in automated scanning of poetry and lyrics.

This summer I want to play with scansion, meter, and rhyme, rather than a specific text. I will use John Lennard's 'The Poetry Handbook' as a guide and source of example/exercises.

This started out as a rough little script, but it shows enough promise that I decided to make a repository and apply some discipline.

Currently the only dependency is on Allison Parrish's excellent interface to CMU's dictionary of pronunciations, but that is likely to change.

The public repository only has text that is in the public domain, of course, but you can put other text in /Texts/NonFreeTexts/ as well. The gitignore file has been set to ignore anything you place there.
