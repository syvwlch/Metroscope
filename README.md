# Metroscope
Experiments in automated scanning of poetry and lyrics.

This summer I want to play with scansion, meter, and rhyme, rather than a specific text.

The public repository only has text that is in the public domain, of course, but you can put other text in /Texts/NonFreeTexts/ as well. The gitignore file has been set to ignore anything you place there.
